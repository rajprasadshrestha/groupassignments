2,"Estimates are subject to sampling error. This error can be expressed as a standard error. All estimates contained in this table have been assigned a letter value to indicate the quality of the estimate, as measured by the standard error (expressed as a percentage). A = Excellent (0.00% to less than 2.50%), B = Very good (2.50% to less than 5.00%), C = Good (5.00% to less than 7.50%), D = Acceptable (7.50% to less than 10.00%), E = Use with caution (10.00% to less than 15.00%), F = Too unreliable to be published (Greater than or equal to 15%, data are suppressed)."
3,"Figures may not add to 100% due to rounding."
4,"This includes all employees who would receive a Statement of Remuneration Paid (T4). Excluded from number of employees are business owners, contract workers and other personnel who would not receive a T4."
5,"Majority ownership is defined at 51% or more. Majority-ownership was self-reported for private sector businesses only. Majority owners can be counted in more than one ownership category."
6,"The term LGBTQ2 refers to persons who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and/or two-spirited."
7,"Respondents were asked if the business or organization identified as being majority owned (51% or more) by any visible minority. If so, the business or organization was asked to identify all visible minority types that made up majority ownership. Figures may not represent majority ownership by a specific visible minority."
